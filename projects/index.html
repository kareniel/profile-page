    <p> 
      i'm currently working on a little web app that lets you easily nurture a tribe by writing newsletters.
      it's still very much in progress but it's coming along nicely. i work on it at a slow pace, on evenings
      and weekends.
      you can <a href="https://indieletter.com">find it here</a>
